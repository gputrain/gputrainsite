Hello there. I am Joseph Matthew.

Welcome to my space, where I share some Jupyter notebook based experiments in my self-directed learning journey around machine learning and data wrangling. I enjoy developing solutions to real-world problems that leverage massive parallel architectures like the cloud, Apache Spark, and GPUs. 

I am updating this site
